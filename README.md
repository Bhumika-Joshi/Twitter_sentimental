# Twitter-Sentimental( Codemix Sentimental Analysis)



I have used Googletrans which is a free and unlimited python library that implemented Google Translate API.
Due to limitations of the web version of google translate, this API does not guarantee that the library would work properly at all times.
(so please use this library if you donâ€™t care about stability.)
